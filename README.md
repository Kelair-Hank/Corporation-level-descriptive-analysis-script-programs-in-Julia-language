<b>Introduction:</b><br />
Corporation level descriptive analysis script programs written in Julia language. They are able to do complex tabular data cleaning together with descriptive statistics. The output is a corporation level formally formatted result table (Data Frame). <br />

<b>Features:</b><br />
GroupedCategoricalStats.jl contains functions used to do descriptive analysis on multiple categorical variables (columns) in a tabular data frame grouped into several sub data frames by another categorical variable. <br />
GroupedContinuousStats.jl contains functions used to do descriptive analysis on multiple continuous variables (columns) in a tabular data frame grouped into several sub data frames by another categorical variable. <br />
ExtractVariablesForTFL.jl contains functions used to combine results from the previous 2 programs into a corporation level formally formatted result table (Data frame). <br />
